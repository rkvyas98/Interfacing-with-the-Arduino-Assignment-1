    <p>
        Create a video (or a screencast) of your circuit in action. <br> <br>

        If you have real hardware then demonstrate the real circuit. If you do not have real hardware then use the simulator. <br> <br>

        Regardless of which method you use, provide a link to the location of your video or screencast on the Internet. Do not upload your video here. <br> <br>

        Show the behavior of the system under 3 conditions: <br><br>

        1.no buttons pressed      <br>
        2.button 1 pressed alone <br>
        3.button 2 pressed alone <br>
